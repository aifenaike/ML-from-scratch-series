# ML-from-scratch-series
Implementation of several machine learning algorithms from scratch. Some of which includes:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forests


These implemented algorithms will also be compared to sklearn's implementation and tested on dummy datasets.
